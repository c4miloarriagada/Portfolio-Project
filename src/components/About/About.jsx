          bootcamp and i think that was a amazing experience , 
          i was working for a lot of years in the aviation field as cabin crew and also i studied for be a commercial pilot.<br/> 
          For that reason i developed soft skills and understood the importance of that skills.<br/>
          Comunication , 
          teamwork, problems management and resolution, are some of my features. For now i'm searching new challenges in my professional carrer while i keep studying other technologies, i literally fell in love with back end and language like TypeScript, is amazing. <br/> 
          But i dont have any problem to work in front end with React Js and tools like redux or simply learn another framework, this website was developed in React Js and Bootstrap 5.
          <br/>
